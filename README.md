Automatically saves your Discord friends, servers and loads them.<br/>
This could be useful as Discord can ban you at any time, for any unreliable reason.

**4 features:**
1. Save friends
2. Save servers (creates a permanent invite link for all servers)
3. Add saved friends
4. Join saved servers

## Usage
Run this command in CMD, terminal or PowerShell (if you don't already have the **requests** module installed):
```
pip install requests
```
